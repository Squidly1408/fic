# Project Database or Luvium 

This is the updated version Project Database ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/Squidly1408/project_database)). 

The orignal version of this project is designed developed and deployed to allow students at [Cooks Hill Campus](https://cookshill-s.schools.nsw.gov.au/), the Big Picture Education school based in Newcastle, to research and devle into the depths of rpevious or current projects at Cooks Hill Campus. This allows for increased collaboration and ideas. a greater pool of knowledge for students to delve into and a way possible way for students ato make connections.

However, the idea of Luvium is changing like all good project they adapt and Luvium has adapted. Currently I am working with The Univeristy Of Newcastle's staff in developing, designing and improving Luvium for the use cases of work intergrated learning and more.
